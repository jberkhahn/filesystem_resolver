# Filesystem Resolver

This is a vLLM general plugin for dynamically discovered LoRA adapters from a local directory.
To use, set VLLM_PLUGIN_LORA_CACHE_DIR to a local directory. When vLLM receives a request
for a LoRA adapter `foobar` it doesn't currently recognize, it will look in that local directory
for a subdirectory `foobar` containing a LoRA adapter. If such an adapter exists, it will
load that adapter, and then service the request as normal. That adapter will then be available
for future requests as normal.

## Testing

HF_TOKEN must be set for the tests to run.
